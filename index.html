          <p>Sub-visible particles (SVPs) in biologic drug products are closely monitored because their presence and properties can influence immunogenicity, product stability, and clinical performance.<sup>1</sup> However, routine analytics still emphasize particle counts and size distributions, leaving the richer morphological information in imaging data largely underused. In this project, we explore an image-based, unsupervised framework that groups SVPs according to shared visual characteristics and summarizes each sample as a morphology profile. Using thousands of particle images from multiple commercial products, we show that visually coherent particle morphologies can be organized into a limited number of clusters, while ambiguous particles remain unclassified. The resulting morphology profiles provide a compact, interpretable view of particle diversity across samples and highlight the potential value of morphology-aware SVP characterization alongside conventional metrics.</p>

      Sub-visible particles (SVPs) are proteinaceous aggregates and other particulates in the micrometre range that are treated as critical quality attributes in therapeutic biologics.<sup>1</sup> They are monitored because their presence and properties can influence immunogenicity, product stability, and clinical performance.

      <p>
        However, in routine practice, SVP analysis is still dominated by particle counting and sizing methods that provide overall concentrations, size distributions, and a few simple shape descriptors. This means that the morphological and compositional information contained in flow imaging microscopy (FIM) data remains largely unused, limiting our ability to fully characterize SVP populations.<sup>1</sup>

      <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Unsupervised morphology-aware framework</h3>
      <p>
        We introduce an unsupervised framework that groups sub-visible particles according to shared visual characteristics, treating image appearance as the primary basis for organization. The framework uses image-derived representations of individual particles to place visually similar particles into the same morphology-defined groups.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subtitle is-5">From raw images to individual particles</h3>
      <p>
        Raw flow imaging microscopy frames are first processed to isolate individual particles and remove obvious artefacts. Each particle crop is then transformed into a compact feature representation that captures key aspects of its morphology, such as overall outline, internal structure, and texture patterns.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Grouping by morphology</h3>
      <p>
        Within this feature space, particles that exhibit similar visual characteristics are assigned to the same morphology-based group, forming clusters that reflect recurring shapes and appearances. Particles that do not show sufficient similarity to any existing group are left unclassified, avoiding forced assignments that could obscure meaningful differences.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subtitle is-5">Sample-level morphology profiles</h3>
      <p>
        For each sample, we aggregate cluster memberships into a morphology profile that reports the relative abundance of particles in each group, together with the fraction of unclassified particles. These profiles provide a concise, comparative view of how particle morphologies vary across products, conditions, or process settings.

        We clustered several thousand images of sub-visible particles collected from ten commercially available pharmaceutical products. The goal was to explore whether particles could be grouped based solely on visual similarity, without prior labeling or assumptions about particle type.

        An unsupervised clustering algorithm was applied to image-derived features, grouping particles according to similarities in their visual appearance. This approach allows patterns to emerge directly from the data, rather than being imposed by predefined categories.

     <h3 class="subtitle is-5 has-text-weight-bold">Visual Separation Between Particle Types</h3>
     <div class="content">
      <p>
        The visual separation between clusters arises from grouping particles based on shared image-derived features. Particles within a cluster consistently exhibited similar characteristics, such as shape and texture, while clear differences were observed between clusters, indicating reproducible morphological patterns rather than arbitrary grouping.

     <h3 class="subtitle is-5 has-text-weight-bold">Uneven Cluster Populations</h3>
     <div class="content">
      <p>
        Cluster sizes varied substantially, with some morphologies occurring far more frequently than others. This uneven distribution likely reflects the natural variability of particle populations present in the dataset.

     <h3 class="subtitle is-5 has-text-weight-bold">Ambiguous and Unclustered Particles</h3>
     <div class="content">
      <p>
        Some particles could not be confidently assigned to a cluster due to mixed or intermediate visual features. These unclustered images likely represent transitional morphologies or overlapping particle types, highlighting the continuous nature of particle appearance.

        Overall, the clustering framework provides a practical way to reduce the complexity of large image datasets while preserving meaningful morphological variation. It enables efficient exploration of dominant particle types while retaining flexibility for ambiguous cases.
